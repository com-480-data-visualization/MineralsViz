**Objectives of the project:**

The main goal of this project is to understand what an energy transition means from the point of view of minerals. Nobody really cares about mining and the impact it can have on our planet. With these visualizations, I want to try and show in a simple and comprehensive way what's at stake in this transition.


**Project Structure:**
The project follows a guideline from global warming to mineral extraction. The idea is to start from the bottom and go deeper and deeper.
Everything will take place on the same globe throughout the exploration, with different layers being added or removed as you go along.

3. **Minerals Extraction**

4. **Energy transition scenario**
	- Sketch: 
	- Tools: 
	- Lecture:

**Additional idea** (weather permitting): 
- Extend to other scenarios 
- Add other possible impacts (visualize import/export routes and the pollution generated, look at the impact on the landscape of the expansion of the mines needed for such large-scale production (size, etc.).
